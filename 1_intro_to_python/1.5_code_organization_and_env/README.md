# 1.5 Organization of code and environment

### 1.5.1 The sum of digits in the line
> Your goal is to write a program (script) that will run from the command line. The program takes as its argument a string consisting of numbers. It is guaranteed that there are no other characters in the passed parameter and the input is always a non-empty string. The program has to calculate the sum of digits that make up the string and print the result to the standard output.

### 1.5.2 Display the stairs
> You need to write a script that "draws" (displays on the console) a ladder. The number of steps in the staircase is passed to the script as a parameter. It is guaranteed that only integers > 0 are sent to the input.ï»¿ Read the data in the same way as described in the previous task. The steps should be displayed with the lattice symbol "#" and spaces.

### 1.5.3 Roots of a quadratic equation
> Your task is to write a program that runs on the command line with parameters, calculates the values of the roots of a quadratic equation and prints them out. The input to the program is the coefficients a, b, and c. It should print out two roots of the quadratic equation. Notice how the roots are printed - each on a new line.
>
> In order not to complicate your task, all the coefficients we will give you as input are the coefficients that end up giving the 2 roots of the quadratic equation.
