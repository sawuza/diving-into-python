# 2.3 Functions

### 2.3.6 Key-values repository
> We will implement our own key-values storage. The data will be stored in the file storage.data. Adding new data to the storage and retrieving the current values is done with the command line utility storage.py.

### 2.3.7 Decorator to_json
> Write a to_json decorator that you can apply to various functions to convert their return value into JSON format. Don't forget to save the correct name of the function being decoded.
